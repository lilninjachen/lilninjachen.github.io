            <h1>A7: Final Project Proposal!</h1>
            <p>
            For <b> Part 1</b>, I finished building my lamp. <br><br>
            Last week, I created a one polysurface dodecahedron as the foundation for my lamp. My plan was to print it in one go until Prof Nadya's recommendation to me in class.<br>
            She suggested that I consider printing out each side of the dodecahedron and use clips to connect them. This way, I didn't have to print the lamp all at once, plus I could build upon my previous assignment (Grasshopper clip and nesting object)<br>
            Most profs know best, so I decided to incorporate her feedback into my overall design. I re-did my design with 5 different variations (three for Style 1, 2 and 3, two for Style 4, and one for Style 5) to achieve the 12-sided polyhedra. <br>
            The variations were based on the stars and circle cutouts to the design. To complete the build, I printed out 30 mini versions of my updated Grasshopper clips to piece them all together.<br>
            After completing all the 3D printing, which took a few days, I assembled the pieces and built my lamp! A more detailed journey is below. <br><br>
