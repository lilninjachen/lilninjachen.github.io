            <p>
            For <b> Part 1</b>, I completed my lamp as a follow up to last week's assignment. <br><br>
            Last week, I created a one polysurface dodecahedron as a base for my lamp. My plan was to print it in one go until Prof Nadya's recommendation to me in class.<br>
            She suggested that I considered printing out each side of the dodecahedron and use clips to build them. This way, I didn't have to print it all at once, plus I could build upon my previous work (pentagon and Grasshopper clips)<br>
            Most profs know best, so I decided to incorporate her feedback into my overall design. I updated my design with 5 different face styles (three for Style 1, 2 and 3, two for Style 4, and one for Style 5) to achieve the 12-sided polyhedra. <br>
            Also, I added stars and circle cutouts to the design. To complete the build, I printed out 30 mini versions of my updated Grasshopper clips to piece them all together. Key milestones and files of my journey are below! <br><br>
