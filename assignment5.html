            <h1>A5: Lamps part 2! And molding and casting part 1!</h1>
            <p>
            For <b> Part 1</b>, I finished building my lamp. <br><br>
            Last week, I created a one polysurface dodecahedron as the foundation for my lamp. My plan was to print it in one go until Prof Nadya's recommendation to me in class.<br>
            She suggested that I consider printing out each side of the dodecahedron and use clips to connect them. This way, I didn't have to print the lamp all at once, plus I could build upon my previous assignment (Grasshopper clip and nesting object)<br>
            Most profs know best, so I decided to incorporate her feedback into my overall design. I re-did my design with 5 different variations (three for Style 1, 2 and 3, two for Style 4, and one for Style 5) to achieve the 12-sided polyhedra. <br>
            The variations were based on the stars and circle cutouts to the design. To complete the build, I printed out 30 mini versions of my updated Grasshopper clips to piece them all together.<br>
            After completing all the 3D printing, which took a few days, I assembled the pieces and built my lamp! A more detailed journey is below. <br><br>

            I started by updating my Rhino file, which involved creating each face and then coming up with different variations using stars/circle cutouts. <br>
            There was definitely some iteration happening with making sure my pentagons were tall/wide enough and thick enough for the lamp. <br><br>

            After designing the 5 different variations, I 3D printed them. It took several days to print them because each face took 2 hours each!<br>
            Also, I had some issues with printing in which the PLA was peeling and separating from the bed. I releveled the bed and sprayed some hair spray, which seemed to address the issue. <br>
            The next step was designing the clips. I had to change the size and thickness of the clip to fit my lamp sides, as well as the angles. <br>
            I messed up a few times because I didn't realize rotations in Grasshopper default to radians (not degrees) - oops. So 116.565° is not the same in radians...<br>
            For my first iteration, the clip was definitely not 116°. Oh, and the clip was smaller than a quarter. <br><br>

            Finally, I had all my parts printed out. The one thing to note is that one of the dodecahedron faces has an opening large enough for the plug to fit through...<br>
            ...as well as a tube that extends within the dodecahedron to keep the lamp innerds in place. Credit to Anthony (my partner, roommate and 3D subject matter expert) for this. <br><br>

            For <b> Part 2</b>, I am still in process of designing my mold in Rhino. <br><br>
            I wanted to create a mold to cast large characters in DnD for. To keep things generic, I aimed to create an exclamation mark on a 3"x3" base.<br>
            On Thingiverse, I found <a href='https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3483440/files'>an exclamation mark token</a> in which I painstakingly had to work on in Rhino.<br>
            I used "DraftAngleAnalysis" to identify my parting line, though needed add some manual labor, "MergeAllCoplanarFaces", and then "Split."<br>
            This was definitely something I had to lean on Junchao for (yay, rockstar TA!).<br>
            After the object was split, I went through yet another challenging journey of creating the positives following Prof Nadya's tutorial very closely.<br>
            As the days went on, Rhino became progressively fussy to the point in which it would crash every 10 minutes, have constant issues with viewports, etc.<br>
            All of that is to say, the hours upon hours I poured in really only got me to the <a href='A5-3DPrintMold.3dm'>positives of the mold.</a> <br><br>
            <img src="A5-MoldProgress.png" width=300> <br><br><br>      
            
            Having incredibly short-term memory, I now need to recall how to create the negatives of the mold. This way, I can add the printing keys and sprues before printing out my mold.
