            <p>
            In Part 1 of this assignment, I designed 3D clips in Grasshopper. Below is a snapshot view in Grasshopper and Rhino.<br><br>

            I printed out 10 clips using 3D Printer Robi - though I printed 1 to begin with before batch printing the remaining 9.<br><br>

            I performed some cardboard surgery to get the shapes I wanted, to which I clipped together to create "THE PENTABOMB." It's 100% aesthetically cool, but 1000% useless.<br><br>

            Although based on my roll&shake test, I'm pretty sure it's robust enough to injure someone who gets hit by it. Self-defense home weapon?<br><br>

            Oops! Here was a failed test print. Basically, the glass was too slippery, so I added some L'oreal hairspray to increase the stickiness of the bed surface. <br><br>
