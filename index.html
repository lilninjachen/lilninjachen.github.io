		<h1>Nina Chen | just one "j" shy of being a ninja...</h1>
        	<p> 
		<b> Who am I? </b> <br>
		I am a business consultant by day, graduate student by night. <br><br>
		Professional: Manager within the Human Capital/People practice at EY <br>
		Academic: Undergrad at UW in Business & Psychology and current 1st year Masters student in UW's HCDE program <br>
		Personal: Anime, Board/Video Games, Camping, Food, Snowboarding, Travel, Naps<br><br><br>
			
		<b> Why do I want to learn about digital fabrication? </b> <br>
		Because I have zero experience in this space (or engineering for that matter). We all have to start somewhere! <br><br><br>
			
		<b> What do I hope to learn in the class? </b> <br>
		Given my limited experience, I am excited to just roll up my sleeves and learn as much as I can! <br><br><br>
		
		<b> What do I want to teach your peers? </b> <br>
		I don't have much hard skills to share; however, I enjoy connecting with people! My door's open if you ever want to have a 1:1, brainstorm/ideate on an assignment, or even just do a virtual hangout! <br>
