            <h1>A8: Final Project!</h1>
            After 8 weeks of Digital Fabrication class, it was time to put my skills to the test!<br><br>
            The first step of building the snowboard holder was to design the adapter connecting the wooden base to the rods of the quad mount.<br>
            In Grasshopper, I created the adapter with several screw holes and an extended tube that accepted the rod.<br>
            It was designed so I could easily adjust the screw hole & extended tube size as well as the angle of the tube...<br>
            Since as I've learned through this class, what is designed/measured is not always what is printed.<br><br>

            As expected, I had to iterate through the adapter with each time tweaking the design.<br>
            Given how small the adapter was, it only took ~1 hour to print, so I was able to rapid prototype without too much worry.<br>
            For my <b>first version</b>, I designed the adapter with four screw holes with the same diameter as the screw shaft, plus a tube with same diameter as the rod, at 1/4".<br>
            Unsurprisingly, both the screw holes and tube hole were too small for the screws and rod, respectively. <br><br>

            For the <b>next version</b>, I adjusted the screw and tube holes just a bit larger. 
            I also went from four to three screw holes because I wouldn't have been able to screw in the fourth hole, since the tube was in the way.<br>
            At Anthony's request, I also created chamfers for the screw holes, so that the wood screws would be flush with the surface.<br>
            <i> I was already frustrated with Grasshopper at this point, so I ended up creating the chamfers using cones and "BooleanDifference" in Rhino </i><br><br>

            With some minor tweaking, the screw holes were good to go; however, for some reason, I had problems with designing the right size hole tube to accept the rods.<br>
            Instead of spending hours playing around with different radii, I decided to just print out the tube hole.<br>
            It took less than a minute to print out, meaning I was able to print, test and fine tune the tube hole really quickly.<br>
            I finally was able to print a hole size that fit with the rod pretty well.<br><br>

            It was time to move on to strength testing. Given that these rods were going to be the strength and support for the snowboards, they needed to be strong!<br>
            Using the excess wooden plank I purchased for the base, I screwed in the adapter, attached the rod, and twisted it in various ways.<br>
            With 20% infill, the printed adapter was too weak because not enough material was holding together the tube and the base when applying pressure.<br>
            The snap sound was real quick and clean. Ouch! <br><br>

            <img src="A8-Adapter1v3.jpg" width=300><br><br><br>
            
            Sooooo, I had to up my infill BY A LOT. I went from 20 to 80%.<br>
            I also increased the wall thickness around the holes by quadruple, which I think helped strengthen the area around the holes.<br>
            With these changes, there were notable strength differences in this version.<br>
            I had to use a ton of force, probably more than needed, to cause any stress markings to the adapter.<br><br>

            I was happy with the latest version of the base adapter.<br>
            To round off my base adapter adventures, I needed to dust off the geometry math I learned in middle school to determine the right angle/length.<br>
            Needless to say, I struggled remembering soh-cah-toa/sin-cos-tan. Luckily, Google is my best friend.<br>
            I was able to find a calculator and plug in all my measurements to get the correct calculations.<br>
            Finally, I used those calculations to determine the tube angle on the base adapter.<br><br>

            In reflecting on the process, I have to give a shout out to my consultant/collaborator, Anthony.<br>
            He gave some great suggestions - e.g., chamfers (for aesthetics), printing just the hole vs. entire adapter (to save time), etc. <br>
            Here is my final lineup of all the iterations and versions of my base adapter!<br><br>

            Now onto the next step of the process, which admittedly has less to do with digital fabrication.<br>
            The base I aimed for was 14" x 32", and with the 1x8 I purchased, I needed to cut them down and bring them together.<br>
            Using an oscillating tool with a wood blade, I cut the boards down to 32".<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/eF9ldB4rSnQ07CgYVn" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/eF9ldB4rSnQ07CgYVn">via GIPHY</a></p><br><br><br>
            
            Next, I brought the two boards together.<br>
            I marked the boards to help me determine where the two boards needed to meet.<br><br>
            <img src="A8-BoardsMarking.jpg" width=300><br><br><br>              
            
            Then, I clamped one of the boards down with a joint angle tool.<br><br>
            <img src="A8-BoardsClamping.jpg" width=300><br><br><br>
            
            Using a power tool, I drilled holes into the board in preparation for screwing them together.<br>
            This would support with holding the two boards together, while the wood glue dries.<br><br>

            <img src="A8-BoardswithHoles.jpg" width=300><br><br><br>
            
            It was then time to glue the two boards together!<br>
            Here was the wood glue used. It was pretty old, but still worked.<br><br>
            <img src="A8-WoodGlue.jpg" width=300><br><br><br>
            
            After, I glued the boards together.<br>
            In hindsight, I was pretty aggressive with the wood glue. <br><br>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/6W5OpNlNMk1v7gz4k0" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/6W5OpNlNMk1v7gz4k0">via GIPHY</a></p><br><br><br>
            
            With the boards together, I inserted wooden screws into the holes I drilled.<br>
            This allowed the boards to be held together, while the glue was working its magic!<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/VfYBgQ7IT7D9u3tH9D" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/VfYBgQ7IT7D9u3tH9D">via GIPHY</a></p><br><br><br>
              
            I sanded, smoothed and buffed out any rough edges.<br>
            In particular, the heights between the two boards were not exactly even.<br>
            So I had to level them out in order to screw in my base adapter.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/nLfE7APbRMDK0iV2Bt" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/nLfE7APbRMDK0iV2Bt">via GIPHY</a></p><br><br><br>
            
            The wooden base was now complete!<br>
            I then proceeded to screw in the base adapter, one by one.<br><br>
            <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/YtOmuQ61JcqyQAUyFp" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/YtOmuQ61JcqyQAUyFp">via GIPHY</a></p><br><br><br>
            
            I placed the uncut rods into the base adapter to test how things were looking.<br>
            Either due to friction, weather, or something, the rods were somewhat loose.<br>
            I added some tape to artifically increase the diameter of the rods.<br>
            And added a zip tie, just cause.<br><br>
            <img src="A8-MountPrototype.jpg" width=300><br><br><br>
            
            It was now time to transition to the top of the mount.<br>
            I started by designing the top adapter, which needed to accept the four rods...<br>
            Which also allowed for two horizontal, parallel rods.<br>
            This part was pretty straightforward because I had already "math"-ed out everything earlier.<br>
            Plus I reused a good portion of my previous Grasshopper file to create it.<br>
