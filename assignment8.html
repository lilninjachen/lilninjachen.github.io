            <h1>A8: Final Project!</h1>
            After 8 weeks of Digital Fabrication class, it was time to put my skills to the test!<br><br>
            The first step of building the snowboard holder was to design the adapter connecting the wooden base to the rods of the quad mount.<br>
            In Grasshopper, I created the adapter with several screw holes and an extended tube that accepted the rod.<br>
            It was designed so I could easily adjust the screw hole & extended tube size as well as the angle of the tube...<br>
            Since as I've learned through this class, what is designed is not always what is printed.<br><br>

            As expected, I had to iterate through the adapter with each time tweaking the design.<br>
            Given how small the adapter was, it only took ~1 hour to print, so I was able to rapid prototype without too much worry.<br>
            For my <b> first version </b>, I designed the adapter with four screw holes with the same diameter as the screw shaft, plus a tube with same diameter as the rod, at 1/4".<br>
            Unsurprisingly, both the screw holes and tube hole were too small for the screws and rod, respectively. <br><br>

            For the <b> next version </b>, I adjusted the screw and tube holes just a bit larger. 
            I also went from four to three screw holes because I wouldn't have been able to screw in the fourth hole, since the tube was in the way.<br>
            At Anthony's request, I also created chamfers for the screw holes, so that the wood screws would be flush with the surface.<br>
            <i> I was already frustrated with Grasshopper at this point, so I ended up creating cones and "BooleanDifference" in Rhino </i><br><br>
