            <h1>A6: Molding and casting pt 2!</h1>
            <p>
            As a follow up to Part 1 of my molding and casting journey, I completed the 3D print of my mold-for-mold.<br>
            After finishing the positives, I created the negatives for my mold by placing a larger box that fit around my positives.<br>
            To complete the 3"x3" huge DnD game token, I added some keys and a sprue. It was ready for printing!<br><br>

            However, I ran into some massive Y-axis layer shifting. I had to go through a ton of troubleshooting in between each print to resolve it. <br>
            I tightened the Y (and X) axis, releveled the bed, cleaned & applied adhesive to the glass bed, slowed down the nozzle speed and controlled for humidity and temperature. <br>
            The challenge was that each half of the mold took approximately 7 to 8 hours to print. I lost all of Wed, Thurs and Fri trying to figure this out.<br><br>

            I was running out of time, so I scaled my model down to 2"x2" large DnD game token to reduce my print time.<br>
            Ultimately, tightening the Y-axis seemed to reduce the layer shifting the most. I was barely able to print my mold-for-molds...<br>
            Anthony still had some residual Y-axis layer shifting with his Settlers of Catan pieces, though.<br><br>

            The next step was to create the silicone mold. I had very little time to waste, so everything I did after needed to go smoothly.<br>
            To help, Anthony recommended I use distilled water to determine how much volume I would need for both molds.<br><br>

            I was able to make the *exact* amount of Oomoo, which just barely covered both my molds.<br>
            In hindsight, I should have made a little more Oomoo. I just got super lucky this time around.<br>
            The remaining steps of my silicone mold making went without any hiccups.<br><br>
