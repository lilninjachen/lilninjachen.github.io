            <p>
            For <b> Part 1</b>, I modified two STLs into a printable STL for the assignment. <br><br>
            As a start, I needed to select two STLs, but had trouble choosing which objects to go with. I decided to use a random generator!<br><br>

            Alright, snail shell and carrots it is! I went on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> to look for an STL of a snail shell and carrot. <br><br>

            I loaded the two STL files into Rhino. I "scale" both STLs down to ~1 inch and "reducemesh" the snail shell from 7,000 to 1,000 polygons. The carrot was already 1,000 polygons, so I didn't "reducemesh."<br>
            Both were closed meshes. The next step was to check the meshes using "MeshRepair." The carrot mesh was good, but the snail shell mesh was bad. <br>
            It was unclear why. I repaired the mesh, but it was still throwing me an error? <br><br>

            I proceeded despite the error. Next, I used "meshtoNURB" to change from mesh to NURB. <br>
            It was a success (and didn't take too long unlike what happened in class). I had two closed meshes and two closed polysurfaces! <br><br>

            Finally, I "booleanunion" the two polysurfaces to create this carrot-snailshell STL. Oh! And since I like making small objects, I "scale" it down yet again. <br>
            Despite the success, I still felt it was lacking because I never really resolved the error with the meshes...<br>
            Oh well! It ended up looking like a snail with a unicorn horn though, hehe <br><br>
