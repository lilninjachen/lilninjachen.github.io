            In <b> Part 1 </b> of this assignment, I designed 3D clips in Grasshopper. <br><br>
            I had some challenges with the boolean and extrusion-equivalent functions in Grasshopper, perhaps due to my limited knowledge.<br>
            So I just baked the shapes and used extrude and boolean in Rhino. Hope that was OK?<br>
            Below is a snapshot view in Grasshopper and Rhino.<br><br>
