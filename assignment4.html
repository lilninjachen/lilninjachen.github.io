            <p>
            For <b> Part 1</b>, I modified two STLs into a printable STL for the assignment. <br><br>
            As a start, I needed to select two STLs, but had trouble choosing which objects to go with. I decided to use a random generator!<br><br>

            Alright, snail shell and carrots it is! I went on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> to look for an STL of a snail shell and carrot. <br><br>

            First, I loaded the snail shell STL into Rhino. I "ReduceMesh"ed the snail shell from 7,000 to 1,000 polygons and checked that it was a closed mesh.<br>
            After, I checked the mesh using "MeshRepair, which the wizard showed that it was "a bad mesh." Specifically, the error was that one of the face normal differed from the vertex normals.<br><br>

            With the help of Google and <a href="https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/help-how-can-i-solve-this-problem-when-i-get-this-message-where-the-face-normal-differs-substantially-from-the-vertex-normals/11290?fbclid=IwAR2rqcMscY7rIFjH8cTRf8n3nIiI0WgxGBxE26ThCDy5Jeot5qhiTDKz5dE">Pascale Golay</a>, I was able to fix the issue by using "UnifyMeshNormals" and "RebuildMesh."<br>
            I re-ran "MeshRepair," which fixed the above problem. However, it was still throwing an error.<br>
            There were no naked edges, mesh holes, non-manifold mesh edges, issues with enclosed volume, etc...but the mesh "was self intersecting."<br>
            I didn't really know how to isolate what was self intersecting, though eventually figured it out by selecting "All Edges" in "Edge Analysis."<br>
            It seemed the shell was self-intersecting at the beginning and end of the shell. <br><br>
            <img src="A4-HotMessShell.png" width=300> <br><br><br>
                
            I "Explode"ed the mesh and tried to manually move the points, though it just ended up creating a ton of naked edges.<br>
            I also tried to create meshes using "FillMeshHoles," which seemed to have fixed the self-intersecting areas identified in "Edge Analysis."<br>
            However, when I tried to "meshrepair," it still kept throwing the self-intersecting error. I tried to isolate the additional self-intersecting areas using "Edge Analysis," but didn't find any. <br><br><br>
            
            At this point, I was running out of mental power, ideas, and time. The initial snail shell STL also seemed pretty complicated, so I decided to move on and look for another STL file. <br>
            I found a different STL file for the snail shell and loaded it into Rhino. I "ReduceMesh" the snail shell to 1,000 polygons.<br><br>

            For my second item, I imported the carrot STL file. I didn't need to "ReduceMesh" because it was already at ~1,000 polygons.<br>
            I ran "MeshRepair" and validated that both meshes were good.<br>
            Next, I used "meshtoNURB" to change from mesh to NURB. <br>
            It was a success (and didn't take too long unlike what happened in class). I had two closed meshes and two closed polysurfaces! <br><br>
            <img src="A4-MeshandNURB.png" width=300> <br><br><br>
                
            Finally, I "booleanunion"ed the two polysurfaces to create the carrot-snailshell STL. <br>
            I definitely felt disappointed and incomplete because of the first failed attempt at the snail shell. <br>
            Although as I reflect on it, I was proud of the learning journey I went on. I used Google, tried troubleshooting, and even learned a few new commands! <br>
            For example, we emphasized naked edges, mesh holes, etc. in class, but on my solo journey, I came across "UnifyMeshNormals," "RebuildMesh," and "FillMeshHoles." <br>
            Anywho, here's the final STL product - a snail-a-corn (because it looks like a cross between a snail and a unicorn).<br><br>
