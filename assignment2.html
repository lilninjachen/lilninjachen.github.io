            <h1>A2: Getting Started with 3D Printing!</h1>
            <p>
            The first step of this assignment was to assemble my 3D printer; however, I am incredibly lucky in that many things in my life magically appear and/or work! <br>
            Somehow, there was already a 3D printer built and ready to print at my place. Although, let's be honest. <br>
            It really means I live with my highly capable significant other who is very skilled at engineering stuff. <br>
            And as a gift for Xmas, he got a 3D printer. Anthony has been using it ever since then to fill our lovely office room with, PLA thingies. <br><br>

            In lieu of building a 3D printer, I watched the 30-min video Anthony used to build his. <br>
            While it certainly does not replace the experience of building a 3D printer myself, I have to give kudos to Tombof3DPrintingHorror on how well it articulated the whole build process. <br><br>

            We also made sure to go over the eccentric nuts, build plate level, and loose screws. <br>
            In fact, we probably had to go over each at least 5 times because it takes me a really long time to understand engineering stuff. But I got it! <br>
            Below is Anthony's attempt at describing eccentric nuts. As you may notice, he had to draw it several times because I was struggling to understand it...<br><br>

            Afterwards, we got to the really fun stuff! He showed me all the accessories he has built for his 3D printer, using his 3D printer.<br>
            There is a tool holder (for the Allen wrenches, wrenches, a screwdriver, end snips and spatula). <br>
            There is a tray/drawer to store a bunch of miscellaneous things. <br>
            There is a micro SD to SD card reader adapter (which houses <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D9JIUU0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1&fbclid=IwAR2tCl87XvJbIlKA-IHY9xlsRytxcE3rGjrfLr9zhgAFyFPLj-ecSdwa3HE"> this </a>). <br>
            There is knob that makes lifting the z-axis easier. And there is a filament feed arm. <br>

            I created my own images of the three cookie cutter shapes in Adobe Illustrator.<br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-All.ai">Adobe Illustrator File (All Shapes)</a><br><br><br>
            
            I converted the images to .SVG files.<br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-Body.svg">The Body</a><br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-Legs.svg">The Legs</a><br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-TopHat.svg">The TopHat</a><br><br><br>
            
            I loaded them into Rhino to create my 3D shapes.<br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-Body.3dm">The Body</a><br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-Legs.3dm">The Legs</a><br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-TopHat.3dm">The TopHat</a><br><br><br>
            
            I converted the shapes to .STL files.<br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-Body.stl">The Body</a><br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-Legs.stl">The Legs</a><br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-TopHat.stl">The TopHat</a><br><br><br>

            Finally, I was excited to see these shapes come to life. With the help of rockstar TA Junchao, I 3D printed the TOP HAT!<br>
