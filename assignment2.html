            <h1>A2: Getting Started with 3D Printing!</h1>
            <p>
            The first step of this assignment was to assemble my 3D printer; however, I am incredibly lucky in that many things in my life magically appear and/or work! <br>
            Somehow, there was already a 3D printer built and ready to print at my place. Although, let's be honest. <br>
            It really means I live with my highly capable significant other who is very skilled at engineering stuff. <br>
            And as a gift for Xmas, he got a 3D printer. Anthony has been using it ever since then to fill our lovely office room with, PLA thingies. <br><br>

            In lieu of building a 3D printer, I watched the 30-min video Anthony used to build his. <br>
            While it certainly does not replace the experience of building a 3D printer myself, I have to give kudos to Tombof3DPrintingHorror on how well it articulated the whole build process. <br><br>

            We also made sure to go over the eccentric nuts, build plate level, and loose screws. <br>
            In fact, Anthony probably had to go over each at least 5 times because it takes me a really long time to understand engineering stuff. But I got it! <br>
            Below is his attempt at describing eccentric nuts. As you may notice, Anthony had to draw it several times because I was struggling to understand it...<br><br>

            Afterwards, we got to the really fun stuff! He showed me all the accessories he has built for his 3D printer, using his 3D printer.<br>
            1) There is a <a href="tool-holder.stl">tool holder</a> (for the Allen wrenches, wrenches, a screwdriver, end snips and spatula). <br>
            2) There is a <a href="drawer.stl">tray/drawer</a> to store a bunch of miscellaneous things. <br>
            3) There is a micro SD to SD card reader adapter - <a href ="adapter-front-plate.stl">front</a>, <a href ="adapter-back-plate.stl">back</a> (which houses <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D9JIUU0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1&fbclid=IwAR2tCl87XvJbIlKA-IHY9xlsRytxcE3rGjrfLr9zhgAFyFPLj-ecSdwa3HE"> this</a>). <br>
            4) There is a <a href ="Zaxis-knob.stl">knob</a> that makes lifting the z-axis easier.<br>
            5) There is a filament feed arm - <a href ="Filament-end-clip.stl">part A</a>, <a href = "Filament-guide-flat.stl">part B</a>. <br><br>

            And bonus! The googly eyes (though these weren't printed). It makes "Robi" that much cuter!<br><br>

            The last thing I did was print a bed gap. As part of HCDE 533, I decided to purchase the recommended glass bed, which Anthony did not have (he had the standard magnetic bed). <br>
            This was key to avoid having to adjust the printer each time we switched the beds, either by turning each bed level or raising/lowering the Z-axis end stop switch by same amount. <br>
            Since I personally hadn't printed anything yet, there was bound to be an error right off the bat. Basically, I came across my failed print - curse you, 3D printing gods! I then leveled the bed... <br>
            I had to select "Auto Home" and then "Disable Stepper Motors" on the screen. Using a piece of paper, I wedged it between the nozzle and bed, testing the resistance of each corner and adjusting the knobs.<br>
            Once I adjusted the build plate level, I was able to print out the bed gap with no problem! Below I have what the bed gap looks like in Cura, the failed print, the bed leveling, and successful print!<br><br>

            Finally, I measured the bed gap to make sure it was the same between the difference of the glass and magnetic bed, and then attached it onto the 3D printer. <br>
            I switched out the magnetic bed with the glass one, which meant I was finally ready to move onto the second part of the assignment!<br><br>

            The second step of this assignment was to test print and measure a bunch of things. Here's the collective crew of PLA thingies I printed per the Canvas assignment!<br><br>
