            <h1>A2: Getting Started with 3D Printing!</h1>
            <p>
            The first step of this assignment was to assemble my 3D printer; however, I am incredibly lucky in that many things in my life magically appear and/or work! <br>
            Somehow, there was already a 3D printer built and ready to print at my place. <br>
            Although, let's be honest. It really means I live with my highly capable significant other who is very skilled at engineering stuff. <br>
            And as a gift for Xmas, he got a 3D printer. Anthony has been using it ever since then to fill our lovely office room with, stuff. <br>

            I sketched the three cookie cutter shapes I had in mind to create my 3D cookie animal.<br>

            I prototyped the 3D shape using paper. It became a turtle-dino-Lapras tribrid of a gentleman! I call him, Sir Lapi!<br>

            I created my own images of the three cookie cutter shapes in Adobe Illustrator.<br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-All.ai">Adobe Illustrator File (All Shapes)</a><br><br><br>
            
            I converted the images to .SVG files.<br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-Body.svg">The Body</a><br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-Legs.svg">The Legs</a><br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-TopHat.svg">The TopHat</a><br><br><br>
            
            I loaded them into Rhino to create my 3D shapes.<br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-Body.3dm">The Body</a><br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-Legs.3dm">The Legs</a><br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-TopHat.3dm">The TopHat</a><br><br><br>
            
            I converted the shapes to .STL files.<br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-Body.stl">The Body</a><br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-Legs.stl">The Legs</a><br>
            <a href="A1-MyFirstRhinoModel-TopHat.stl">The TopHat</a><br><br><br>

            Finally, I was excited to see these shapes come to life. With the help of rockstar TA Junchao, I 3D printed the TOP HAT!<br>
